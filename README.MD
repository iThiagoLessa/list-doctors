# Introduction
first you need to open the project in your editor code, and have to run the following command:

1 - npm run start:server -> to run the json Server;
2 - npm run start:client -> to run the project in mode development in port 9000 (http://localhost:9000/);

In my tests to change this project to add ReactJs, i changed the output in webapack and installed some dependencias in my projeto to run the react.

# About the decision to apply SASS
I decided to use SASS in my projecto because actually i'm studying about this preprocessor which is one of the most respected in the world.
